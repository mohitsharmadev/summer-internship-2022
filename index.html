        </div>
        <p1>HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and web applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.

        Hyper Text: HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.
        
        Markup language: A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.
        
        Web Page: A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page can be identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML only, we can create static web pages.

        <p2> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to design a webpage to make it attractive. The reason for using this is to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It allows you to apply styles on web pages. More importantly, it enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.

            <h1> HTML Attributes
            </h1>
            
        </div>
        <p3>In this article, we will know HTML Attributes, their implementation through the examples. All HTML elements have attributes that will provide additional information about that particular element. It takes 2 parameters, ie, a name & a value which define the properties of the element and are placed inside the element tag.
            
            The name parameter takes the name of the property we would like to assign to the element and the value takes the properties value or extent of the property names that can be aligned over the element. Every name has some value that must be written within quotes.
            
            Syntax:
            
            <element attribute_name="attribute_value">
                Supported Attributes: It is a global attribute that is supported by all the tags.
                
                Please refer to the HTML Attributes Complete Reference article for all the attributes in detail.
                
                The below are some of the most commonly used Attributes in HTML.
                
                HTML src Attribute: If we want to insert an image into a webpage, then we need to use the <img> tag and the src attribute. We will need to specify the address of the image as the attribute’s value inside the double quote.
                
                Example: This example explains the HTML src Attributes to specify the source address of the file.

            <div class="mdiv" id="why">
                
                <h1>why css used in HTML?</h1>
            </div>
             <ul>
                <li>Solves a big problem: Font, color, background style, element alignments, border, and size tags had to be duplicated on each web page before CSS. This was a lengthy procedure.
                </li>
                <li>Saves a lot of time: Because CSS style definitions are stored in external CSS files, updating only one file can modify the entire website.
                </li>
                <li>Provide more attributes: CSS gives more specific features for defining the look and feel of a website than simple HTML.
                </li>
                <li>Pages load faster: CSS doesn’t require you to write HTML tag attributes all of the time. A tag’s rule can be written once and applied to all instances of the tag. As a result, CSS uses less code, resulting in speedier download times.
                </li>
                <li> Easier Website maintenance: CSS makes website maintenance much easier. If we need to make a global change to the file, we can simply alter the style, which will update all of the elements on the web page.
                    
                </li>
                <li>Multiple device compatibility: We can use CSS with older language versions because it is compatible with them. CSS makes it possible to optimize material for several devices.
